# Bikesharing

## Overview

We were tasked with pitching a bikeshare company to the city of Des Moines, Iowa with using a breakdown of existing data from CitiBike, a bikeshare company in New York City. In this analysis it is helpful to start with a few key questions:

- Who uses bikeshare programs?
- What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
- What time of day are bikes used the most?
- How often and long are the bikes used and by what demographics?

## Results

These results can be found in an interactive story if your click here:

Most of the users are male subscribers

Most users are using the bikes in high commuter and tourist areas

A large majority of the rides last only 20 minutes or less with a peak at five minutes



## Summary

Bikeshare services can be very popular in metropolitan areas, where occupied real estate is densely packed and parking spaces may be scarce. From the analysis we see the service is mostly used by male subscribers who are primarily using the bikes as mode of transportation in the commutes to and from work. 

- One additional visualization that was not included in the analysis, but might be beneficial would be a chart that shows where most starting and ending points are based on gender. This would give us an idea of which demographics are using the service for what purposes.

- Another visualization that was not included in the analysis, but might be beneficial would be a chart that displays how frequently certain bikes are being used. This would help determine what bikes need serviced the most.
